## 🕹️ Gameplay
The ball never stops moving. Your job is to keep its rhythm and land perfectly on the platforms.  
Each perfect bounce earns points, but one missed jump ends your run instantly.  
As you progress, platforms move faster, get smaller, and appear at sharper angles — testing your reflexes.

## 💡 Tips to Improve
- Tap in rhythm; don’t spam clicks.  
- Watch the bounce height to predict timing.  
- Stay calm — rhythm matters more than speed.  
- Learn from misses — each run gets you better.
